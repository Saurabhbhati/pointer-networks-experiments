# Pointer networks experiments

Basic experiments with pointer networks for Travelling salesman problem 

TSP_rawcord.py - TSP with raw coordinates 
TSP_graph.py  - TSP with distance graph as input 

This software builts upon [https://github.com/keon/pointer-networks](https://github.com/keon/pointer-networks).

Using Keras 2? [Try the keras-2.0 branch](https://github.com/zygmuntz/pointer-networks-experiments/tree/keras-2.0).
